      <div class="white section-container">
        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p class="hero-subtitle white">
          NWM International operates as a founder-led firm, working in close
          partnership with clients and acting as an extension of their
          leadership and operational teams.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="hero-subtitle white">
          Each engagement begins with a clear understanding of the client’s
          context, constraints, and objectives. Strategic advisory, negotiation
          expertise, and executive or team coaching are then combined to support
          clarity, alignment, and effective execution.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="hero-subtitle white">
          The firm deliberately limits the number of simultaneous engagements to
          ensure depth, senior involvement, and discretion throughout the
          collaboration.

          <h2>About the Founder</h2>
          <p>
            Nadiia Woodhouse is an international business consultant and
            executive coach with 17+ years of leadership experience in retail,
            procurement, and business development, operating at group, market,
            and category level within complex international environments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her background includes global buying and sourcing leadership roles
            within leading international retail groups, where she was
            accountable for strategic sourcing, profitability, supplier
            ecosystems, and international private label development across the
            DIY and home improvement sector.
          </p>
          <p>
            At group level, she led the definition and deployment of
            international purchasing strategies, managing large-scale supplier
            portfolios and multi-country teams. Her scope consistently combined
            commercial performance, strategic negotiations, and organisational
            transformation, delivering sustained growth in turnover, margin, and
            operational efficiency across multiple product categories.
          </p>
          <p>
            Earlier in her career, she drove market and category transformations
            in Central and Eastern Europe, including the structuring and scaling
            of complex retail departments and omnichannel models. These
            initiatives resulted in significant revenue acceleration, margin
            improvement, and long-term supplier partnerships, while aligning
            commercial strategy with customer and sustainability objectives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Across her career, Nadiia has negotiated with more than 1,000
            suppliers and international stakeholders, working at the
            intersection of strategy, execution, and human dynamics. This dual
            exposure enables her to support clients not only on strategic
            decisions, but also on how to lead negotiations, teams, and
            organisations effectively in high-pressure, cross-cultural contexts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, through NWM International, she supports suppliers, retailers,
            and senior leaders with strategic advisory, negotiation support, and
            executive and team coaching, drawing on deep sector expertise in
            DIY, home improvement, building and decorative materials, and
            furniture, with a strong focus on the European end-consumer market.
