         OUR POSITIONING

      <section class="snap-screen dark">
        <div class="snap-content">
          <h2>Our Positioning</h2>

          <p>
            NWM International is a business consulting and executive coaching
            firm supporting suppliers, retailers, and senior leaders operating
            in complex international and cross-cultural environments.
          </p>

          <p>
            The firm works at the intersection of strategy, negotiations, and
            leadership, combining senior-level business advisory with
            professional coaching practices to support both decision-making and
            execution in complex contexts.
          </p>

          <p>
            NWM International’s core expertise lies in DIY, home improvement,
            building and decorative materials, and furniture, within European
            end-consumer and retail-driven markets.
          </p>

          <p>
            Engagements are bespoke, selective, and confidential, designed to
            deliver measurable impact while preserving long-term relationships
            and organisational integrity.

         OUR APPROACH
    ============================== -->
      <section class="snap-screen white">
        <div class="snap-content">
          <h2>Our Approach</h2>

          <p>
            NWM International operates as a founder-led firm, working in close
            partnership with clients and acting as an extension of their
            leadership and operational teams.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each engagement begins with a clear understanding of the client’s
            context, constraints, and objectives. Strategic advisory,
            negotiation expertise, and executive or team coaching are then
            combined to support clarity, alignment, and effective execution.
          </p>

          <p>
            The firm deliberately limits the number of simultaneous engagements
            to ensure depth, senior involvement, and discretion throughout the
            collaboration.
